# MyWebScraper

Hello, my name is Octavia and I am currently a student at Florida Atlantic University. In this, I programmed an efficient webscraping tool using all the libraries listed in the requirements.txt file. The webpage being scrapped is https://stackoverflow.com/users/22656/jon-skeet?tab=questions. While Google Gemini was used for some debugging while installing drivers and some structing, all additional features and coding was done by me.
